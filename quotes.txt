I hate Mondays.
Once again I'm saved by the miracle of...lasagna!
If you are patient...and wait long enough...Nothing will happen!
Good times are ahead! Or behind. Because they sure aren't here.
You know it's Monday when you wake up, and it's Tuesday.
The most active thing about me is my imagination.
With due respect to Will Rogers, I never met a lasagna I didn't like.
Love me, feed me, never leave me.
Diet is 'die' with a 't.'
Oh no! I overslept! I'm late! For my nap.
Eat every meal as though it were your last.
I am hungry. Therefore I am.
If you want to look thinner, hang around people fatter than you.
I think I'm going to blow cat chow chunks.
This is it. I've reached the pinnacle of laziness and gluttony..How depressing. There's no place to go after you've reached the top!
I'm not messy. I'm organizationally challenged!
All I do is eat and sleep. Eat and sleep. Eat and sleep. There must be more to a cat's life than that. But I hope not.
When the lasagna content in my blood gets low, I get mean.
A little ego goes nowhere.
I'm not over-weight, I'm under-tall.
The meek shall inherit squat.
You can bet it wasn't an exercise freak who invented power steering.
I'll rise, but I won't shine.
I eat too much because I'm depressed and I'm depressed because I eat too much. It's a vicious circle..that took years to perfect!
I shall now attempt to eat a diet lunch consisting of one leaf of lettuce lightly seasoned with..one quart of Mayonnaise.
If people were meant to pop out bed we'd all sleep in toasters.
